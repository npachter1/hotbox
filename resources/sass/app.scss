/**
This file is the main style definition for the entire Hotbox application.

Here we define the fonts used, import Bootstrap 4, import the Now UI theme,
and define GLOBAL styles used throughout the application.

Global styles are those used in components throughout the application.
For example, tweaks to the main layout of the application, as well as to
individual components like Datatables.net.

Plugin styles:

If a style will only apply to a specific plugin, just create a new scss
file in the plugins directory and import it in the plugins.scss file.

HOW TO DEVELOP

In the root directory of the application, enter the command:

    npm run development

You should see information printed to the screen, including the line:

    DONE  Compiled successfully in XXXms

Any time you make a change to the files, the application stylesheet and
javascript code will be automatically re-built.  You may need to reload
your browser to see changes.
